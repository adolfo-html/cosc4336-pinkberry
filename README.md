# READ ME

# COSC 4336 Software Development - Pinkberry - Collaborative repo for group project

(Adolfo 9/23)

Hi everyone, this is the official GitHub repository for our Windows desktop group project! Finally!!!

This document is where I will be chronologically dumping all of my thought process as I move through this project. I'll be typing out how I program stuff and why I program it a certain way, as well as warnings, learning points, explanations, and dependencies. This really helps me, and I hope it helps you, too. The README file is super important for any GitHub project.

Along with this, I'll also put comments in my code (in the actual Python code files, once they get uploaded here), so I'll make everything I do as clear and easy-to-understand as possible. I want this doc to be a "timeline" of how we went from nothing to a whole working product.

## Let's get started

So, first of all, you gotta know how to use these things:
- Windows cmd
- git
- GitHub (yes they're two different things)
- Python

If you have experience using these, great! If not, FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nah jk, it's actually pretty fun. If you're just getting into all this, there's no shame in asking for a quick tutorial, and I'll be happy to help out.

If you want to make changes to this doc (you're prolly gonna have to), it uses Markdown (the .md extension) for its markup. Easiest shit ever, trust. Just download this file and see how to do things like **bold text**, `code blocks`, headings, lists, and more.

# The Project

## Summary

This project will deliver an LCARS-style interface layered over existing desktop systems. It will display files, drives, and additional features in a colorful, Star Trek–style, user-friendly package.

## Objectives

Provide Prof. Morris an executable LCARS-style desktop overlay for the existing interface by November 29, 2025. It will include all features in the project objectives; any additional features will be added after the base scope is complete.
1. Create a storage display system showing drive name, available/used space, percent usage, and drive type. (Oct 18)
2. Build a file manager to display files with editing, execution, and read/write capabilities. (Oct 25)
3. Add cursor and display interaction with Star Trek–style sounds (lasers, pneumatics, beeps, boops). (Nov 15)
4. Deliver a complete LCARS interface integrating all features and additional enhancements. (Nov 29)

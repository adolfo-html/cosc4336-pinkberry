# COSC 4336 Software Development - Pinkberry - Collaborative repo for group project

(Adolfo 9/23)

Hi everyone, this is the official GitHub repository for our Windows desktop group project! Finally!!!

This document is where I will be chronologically dumping all of my thought process as I move through this project. I'll be typing out how I program stuff and why I program it a certain way, as well as warnings, learning points, explanations, and dependencies. This really helps me, and I hope it helps you, too. The README file is super important for any GitHub project.

Along with this, I'll also put comments in my code (in the actual Python code files, once they get uploaded here), so I'll make everything I do as clear and easy-to-understand as possible. I want this doc to be a "timeline" of how we went from nothing to a whole working product.

## Let's get started

So, first of all, you gotta know how to use these things:
- Windows cmd
- git
- GitHub (yes they're two different things)
- Python

If you have experience using these, great! If not, FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nah jk, it's actually pretty fun. If you're just getting into all this, there's no shame in asking for a quick tutorial, and I'll be happy to help out.

If you want to make changes to this doc (you're prolly gonna have to), it uses Markdown (the .md extension) for its markup. Easiest shit ever, trust. Just download this file and see how to do things like **bold text**, `code blocks`, headings, lists, and more.
